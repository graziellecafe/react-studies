# React Studies
A repository with study projects on React

## Overview 
React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces. 

Some properties about:
- **Declarative**: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

## Pre-Requisites
On [Tania Rascia website](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/) we can see some pre-requisites for study React. 

There are a few things you should know in advance before you start playing around with React. If you've never used JavaScript or the DOM at all before, for example, I would get more familiar with those before trying to tackle React.

- Basic familiarity with [HTML & CSS](https://www.internetingishard.com/).
- Basic knowledge of [JavaScript and programming](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-javascript).
Basic understanding of the [DOM](https://www.taniarascia.com/introduction-to-the-dom/).
Familiarity with [ES6 syntax and features](https://www.taniarascia.com/es6-syntax-and-feature-overview/).
- [Node.js and npm](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-install-and-use-node-js-and-npm-mac-and-windows/) installed globally.
